# Cognitive Modelling - Tutorial 1

## Table of Contents


## Project Description
This Project is focused on building, simulating, and evaluating computational models to analyze behavioral data from sensory discrimination tasks. This project will explore fundamental steps of cognitive modeling starting with defining models, simulating behavior, and estimating model parameters from real data to validating model predictions, comparing multiple models, and performing model recovery and parameter recovery analyses. 


## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:
### 1.  Python 3.10.12
Ensure you have Python installed. This project was tested using Python 3.10.12, so any version 3.10.12 or higher should work. 

You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Virtual Environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the project dependencies isolated. You can create a virtual environment with the following command: 
- On **macOS/Linux**:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```
- On **Windows**:

    ```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```



### 3. Install Dependencies 
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```
### 4. Dependencies List
The following Python packages are required and are included in the requirements.txt: 
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- ipywidgets

### Jupyter Notebook
The project uses Jupyter notebooks for execution. You can install Jupyter by running:
    
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
