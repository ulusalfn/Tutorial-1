# Cognitive Modelling - Tutorial 1

## Table of Contents


## Project Description
This Project is focused on building, simulating, and evaluating computational models to analyze behavioral data from sensory discrimination tasks. This project will explore fundamental steps of cognitive modeling starting with defining models, simulating behavior, and estimating model parameters from real data to validating model predictions, comparing multiple models, and performing model recovery and parameter recovery analyses.
